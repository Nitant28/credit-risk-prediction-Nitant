Full Stack Data Science — End-to-End Machine Learning Systems
Developed by Nitant Singh

This repository contains multiple fully structured, production-aligned machine learning projects.
The work demonstrates the ability to design, build, and deliver complete data-driven applications, covering the full lifecycle from data exploration to deployment readiness.

Overview

Traditional machine learning work often stops at building models inside notebooks.
This repository presents complete solutions that reflect real-world ML engineering expectations.
